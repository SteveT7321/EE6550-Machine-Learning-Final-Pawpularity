In this Kaggle contest "Pawpularity," we had the opportunity to participate in a fascinating challenge that involved predicting the cuteness of stray dogs or cats. The underlying motivation behind this contest was to find improved ways of understanding and assessing these adorable animals. By leveraging advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aimed to identify the factors that contribute to their appeal and likability. Ultimately, the goal was to provide valuable insights that could lead to better adaptations and accommodations for these precious creatures, ultimately improving their well-being and chances of finding loving homes. Furthermore, In this competition, participants are provided with a substantial dataset comprising images of domestic animals for training and testing purposes. Each image is accompanied by a set of metadata containing diverse features, including the crucial Pawpularity score, which is available only in the training set. While various machine learning approaches can be employed to model the dataset, we focus on the usage of the Swin-transformer, which had shown great performance in image analysis and align with our initial intuition for tackling this task.
